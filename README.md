Week 1 React Project

This project is my first experience with React.  It could probably be tweaked some.  I don't believe I made the correct use of the index file, but it functioned all the same.  With this first venture with React, I created a navigation bar and a login form.  So I got to create Navigation component (I made the Login form within the index.js).  Also did some minimal CSS design.
